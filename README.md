# LDA_Topic_Modeling_Project
Topic modeling using LDA on movie reviews dataset 

Overview

For this project, I applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to perform topic modeling on textual data. The main goal was to uncover the hidden topics within a collection of text data and then visualize those topics using donut charts. I worked with movie review datasets and applied the LDA model for different numbers of topics (5, 10, 20, and 50). After running the LDA model, I used Plotly to create donut charts to visually represent the frequency distribution of these topics.

Files in this Repository

LDA_Topic_Modeling_Project.ipynb:
This is the Jupyter notebook that contains all the code for applying the LDA algorithm to the dataset. It also handles the preprocessing of the text data and generates the donut charts for visualization.

HTML Files:
These files are the donut charts showing the topic distributions for each dataset and topic configuration (5, 10, 20, and 50 topics). You can open these files in any browser to see the visualizations.

Output

In this repository, youâ€™ll find the donut charts saved as HTML files. These charts represent the frequency distribution of topics across the datasets for different numbers of topics (5, 10, 20, and 50). The topics are displayed in descending order of their frequency
